<h2>Localization and translation of <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software</a>
 / <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source software</a></h2>

<p>There are a lot of open source programs that are localized and
translated in to Lithuanian language by initiative members of
Lithuanian open source community.

<p>At the present main desktop environment programs KDE ang GNOME are
localized and translated. Several projects were sponsored by
Information Society Development Committee.

<p>Most of the localized and translated software is published on the
website <a href="http://lietuvybe.akl.lt/">lietuvybe.akl.lt</a> (previously â€“ lietuvybe.org).
