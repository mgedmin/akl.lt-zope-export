<h2>„Linux“ distribution „Knoppix“</h2>

<p>IT exhibition „Info 2003“, Kaunas, April 24-26, 2003.

<p>The aim of this project was to present an <b>Open Source operating
system.</b>

<p>AKL has presented a localized and partially translated „Linux“
operating system „Knoppix“ at IT exhibition „Info 2003“ in Kaunas.

<p>„Knoppix“ is a bootable CD with a collection of GNU/Linux software,
automatic hardware detection, support for many graphics cards,
sound cards, SCSI and USB devices and other peripherals. „Knoppix“ can
be used as a Linux demo, educational CD, rescue system, or adapted and
used as a platform for commercial software product demos. It is not
necessary to install anything on a hard disk. Due to on-the-fly
decompression, the CD can have up to 2 GB of executable software
installed on it.

<p>These are the reasons why we have chosen „Knoppix“ for open source
software presentation. For all willing to have free software installed
in their computers we burned „live CD“ at place in their CD's.

<p>Project was managed by AKL member Mantas Kriaučiūnas. He is the main
initiator of localization, also reporting and fixing
bugs of „Knoppix“ distribution in Lithuania.
