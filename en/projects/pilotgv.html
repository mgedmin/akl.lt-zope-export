<h2>Pilot implementation and trial use of open source software at
Governmental Institutions (2002 / 9 - 11)</h2>

<p>The aim of this project was to pracicaly test and to prove that
it is possible to use open source programs at Governmental
institutions as an alternative to commercial software, and that using
open source programs functionality and productivity of workers is at
competative level.

<p>The project devided into two parts: localization of open source 
software and pilot implementation at work places.

<h4>LOCALIZATION</h4>

<p>The aim was to localize programs for office work automation, mail 
client and browser. The software chosen was: office suite <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org">„OpenOffice.org“</a>  and Internet and
mail programs <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">„Mozilla“</a>. 

<h4>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>

<p>During this project period three main products were tested: <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org">„OpenOffice.org“</a>, <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org">„Mozilla“</a> and „Linux“ operating
system in general. Open source software was installed in more than twenty 
desktops at the Ministry of Environment, Center of Information
Technologies of Education and Information Technologies and
Communication Department to the Ministry of the Interior.

<p>Depending on the results of pilot implementation, there were
prepared instructions for open source software users (in Lithuanian
language).

<p>The results of the project surpassed all expectations: there were
no problems that could not be solved during the project and there were
no essential problems that could not let using open source programs at
Governmental institutions.  Results of the project were publicly
announced at press conference held at Information Society Development
Committee at Government of the Republic of Lithuania on the 6th of
December, 2002.
