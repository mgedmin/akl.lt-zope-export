<h2>ROADSHOW</h2>
<h3>eVitamins Roadshow – for raising ICT awareness and computer literacy</h3>
<p>
The idea is to travel around Lithuania's rural areas with all the team by a special bus visiting about 40 towns. At each location we will organize 3-days seminars “giving” each type of eVitamins that we can offer now (see <a href="http://www.akl.lt/en/eVitamins/?doc=about_Vitamins.html">eVitamins section</a>). 
At each place we will organize installfests to help people learn to install open source operating systems and software in their computers. Also - provide technical consulting and find one or two partners that will be trained to provide technical support for local communities, SMEs, schools and local governments.
</p>
<p>
Roadshow is going to be a huge one year project that need partnership to build a consorcium.
