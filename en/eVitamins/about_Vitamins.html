<h2>eVitamins - for growth and wealthy business</h2>

<br>
<p>
The special aim of eVitamins initiative is raising ICT Awareness 
and Computer Literacy in rural areas, because here we
 have digital divide between cities and districts. 
The objective is to demonstrate people a computer 
nd its advantages, teach how to use it for the growth of
 their work and that a computer can be up to 40 percent cheaper using 
free and open source software.

People need much more information for improving their business, work, 
or day-life then computers. They have to learn new methods of making 
business in a modern information society. So, we offer a complex of eVitamins 
for different groups of people and each eVitamin contains of trainings, 
consultancy, exchange of best practices, technical support.

<h2>We offer such "types" of eVitamins:</h2>
<h3>eVitamins for SMEs</h3>
<ol>
  Owners of small and medium enterprises are still afraid to use computers 
in their day life and business. Some of them already use them, but only as 
typewriters. Information and telecommunication technologies can do much more. 
SMEs need to be informed, educated and consulted about the advantages brought 
by ICT. Also, some small ICT companies need to be encouraged to provide technical 
support services for free software users.
</ol>

<h3>eVitamins for Local Government</h3>
<ol>
   Open standards for data and documents exchange in the communication with citizens, SMEs, educational institutions, other administrations, also for public information are a prerequisite for healthy communication, information dissemination, and eDemocracy.
</ol>

<h3>eVitamins for Local Communities</h3>
<ol>
   Citizens, members of local communities need be encouraged to participate in eDemocracy and become involved in the information society. There is a need to inform them about information technologies, legal software.
</ol>

<h3>eVitamins for Education</h3>
<ol>
   Free software for schools is the best choice. An open source of free software encourages students to look inside the programs, their functionality. And these programs allow to do that.
</ol>

<h3>eVitamins for NGOs</h3>
<ol>
   The first and the main thing for any organization is to have a website for information dissemination, an e-mail address for communication, and a virtual place for discussions with members. They need to be instructed about fundraising, how to apply for fundraising, how to fill in applications and find partners. They need to be educated and consulted.
</ol>
