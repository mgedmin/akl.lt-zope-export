Welcome to the the website of a non-profit public organization ”Atviras Kodas 
Lietuvai” (“Open Source for Lithuania”).

<p>
Our mission is to promote the usage of Free and Open Source software 
in Lithuania. To achieve our goals, we initiate and participate in various 
projects at governmental and international level. In the 
<a href="projects">“Projects”</a> section of our site you will 
find more information about our initiatives and implemented projects. 

<p>
It is worth mentioning that we couldn't achieve any significant results without our
