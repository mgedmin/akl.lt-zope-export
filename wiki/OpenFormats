What are open formats ?

Criteria of choosing open document formats for public information:

 - Acceptance. The format must be used by more than one software provider.

 - Independence. The specification of the format cannot be maintained by only one company or a closed association of companies.

 - Portability. The format is guaranteed to be usable on multiple platforms.

 - Implementation by free/open source software. The format must be implemented by open (free/libre) software to ensure that the format can be used and continue to be used free of charge and without restrictions.


(I think we should put here (or above, after the explanation what open formats are) the JPEG (www.jpeg.org) example - it's very good and successful example of open format)

According to these criteria we selected list of open file formats, recommended for use in Lithuanian public sector.

Shortly there are mainly 4 important open document formats (standards):

(put here more english text from broshure)

1. (X)HTML - Worl Wide Web Consorcium standard

 (TODO in Tools section - to test how good HTML is created by OOo 2.0 ? Some time ago there were some talks, that OOo 2.0 will produce standarts (w3c) compliant HTML :)


2. Open Document - OASIS (http://www.oasis-open.org ) standard from 2005 05 01 (big anouncement on OASIS will be on May 18)
 it seems there is only one really open and universal format,
suitable for all kinds of office documents (texts, spreadsheets,
presentations, drawings, math formulas, etc.), which is supported by big and small software 
(and other) companies (TODO: ask in opendocument mailing list what are "National Archive of Australia"
and some other initiators of OpenDocument) has the future - it's OASIS  "Open Document Format" 
(it's an improved OpenOffice.org 1.0 file format):

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office

This format is already used by at least 5 products:

 - OpenOffice.org 2.x,

 - KDE KOffice 1.4, 

 - SUN StarOffice 8.x,

 - IBM Workplace Client

 - "Outside in content viewing and transformation technology" v. 8.0

If someone still doesn't know - OpenOffice.org 2.0 candidate version is available here:

OOo 2.0 beta announcement in Lithuanian language:

User-friendly and up to date article about this format is available here:

http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050130002908154
(I'm strongly suggesting to read at least this article before asking a
question or sending any comments about Open Document format to this
mailing list )

Open Document format is also supported by 1dok project (www.1dok.org/eng/ )
and EU. For more info about OpenDocument format support in EU look at 
http://wiki.akl.lt/UsefulLinks , for example 
http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/3439 (Available documentation on
the Promotion of Open Document Exchange Format) and
http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/2592/5588 (TAC approval on
conclusions and recommendations on open document formats), there are
important recommendations for our project and governmental institutions
(one of the recomendations is "The public sector is encouraged to provide
its information through several formats.")
Also I found this info "The fact that the OASIS OpenDocument standard has
made it's way into EU purchase cycle requirements is significant, but this
is just the beginning."
(look at http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/200502/msg00027.html )

So, it seems this format is the best in most cases, where simple HTML
is not suitable. Only one pretty important disadvantage of this format
is - almost all software, which uses this format, is still in beta stage.
 I think it's not so importat for us, because our project should be 
finished after few months, when OpenOffice.org 2.0 and StarOffice 8.0
stable versions will be released ;)

Some companies, for example Oracle, are planing to use "OpenDocument as a
replacement for .pdf"
http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/200503/msg00003.html

There is an OpenDocument format FAQ - look at http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/200505/msg00012.html (it seems few days permanent link for FAQ will be http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/faq.php )

3. PDF and PDF forms - proprietary but open Adobe standard

 PDF is very good for read-only documents and not so good for simple forms.

 There are several open source tools for creating PDF documents and PDF forms:

 - OpenOffice.org ( www.openoffice.org ) - from 1.1 version can create PDF from any supported text, spreadsheet, presentation or drawing format; 2.0 version can create PDF forms

 - Scribus ( www.scribus.org.uk ), also can create PDF forms:
 http://ahnews.music.salford.ac.uk/scribus/documentation/cgiform/pdf_form.html 
 (we should put it at www.akl.lt/skaitykla )

 - PDFCreator ( www.pdfcreator.de.vu )

There are several open source tools for displaying PDF files, but it
seems there are no open and free user-friendly tool for filling PDF
forms, I found only one command line tool: www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/
and several java libraries - www.pdfbox.org and www.etymon.com/epub.html

The only user-friendly tool for PDF form filling is free, but proprietary
Adobe Reader (previously known as Acrobat Reader). Filling PDF forms
with Lithuanian/Latvian and other non iso8859-1 characters in Linux
could be made only with Adobe Reader version 7.0 (and maybe higher, when they will be available)

Because there is only one proprietary tool for filling PDF forms I think
it would be better not to use PDF forms for changing documents between
public institutions and citizens.


4. XForms - Worl Wide Web Consorcium standard

I think there is better - open and not proprietary standard (and file format)
for filling various forms - it's XForms standart, which is maintained by
World Wide Web consortium (W3C), look at

http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/

In its FAQ I found this info:

XForms can do everything that HTML Forms can do, and then some. In
particular XForms lets you:

* Check data values while the user is typing them in.

* Indicate that certain fields are required, and that the form cannot be
  submitted without them.
* Submit forms data as XML.

* Integrate with Web services, for instance by using SOAP and XML RPC.

* Submit the same form to different servers (for instance a search
  string to different search engines).

* Save and restore values to and from a file.

* Use the result of a submit as input to a further form.

* Get the initial data for a form from an external document.

* Calculate submitted values from other values.

* Constrain values in certain ways, such as requiring them to be in a
  certain range.

* Build 'shopping basket' and 'wizard' style forms without needing
  to resort to scripting.

XForms support can be installed in most popular browsers, for example
Mozilla, Firefox, see http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2005-02-02.html
also in MS Internet Explorer, look at
http://ftp.novell.com/pub/forge/xforms-explorer/docs/home.html and
http://www.formsplayer.com/download/ )
There are also various commercial and free product for XForms design, etc
for example http://www.xformation.com and http://developer.novell.com/xforms/

OpenOffice 2.0 and StarOffice 8.0 beta versions also could be used as
XForms designers, look at this article:
http://www.understandingxml.com/archives/2005/03/xforms_editor_i.html

I've tested FireFox 1.0+ (02-Feb-2005) with installed xforms.xpi plugin
and was satisfied. I think such form filling possibility would really be
suitable for Lithuanian/Latvian citizens and enterprises (eg. currently
Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate gives the possibility to fill tax
forms with web browser, but this works only with M$ Internet Explorer,
because is implemented with M$ .NET tools, which produces HTML
and Javascript, working only with M$ IE :( ).

For more info and various xforms software look at the end of
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/ and also at http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/XForms
