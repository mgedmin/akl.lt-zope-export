PHARE 2002 BAS (English site)

 This site is created to share information with Latvian colleagues. In [PHARE2002BAS] you can find information in Lithuanian language. In the main AKL website there is also more information about the project published - http://www.akl.lt/phare (sorry, still in Lithuanian).

 **Project title:** Pilot Project for Using Open Data Exchange Standards in Local Authorities.

 **Project partners:** AKL, LAKA, Vilnius City Municipality.

 **Project duration:** 6 month (+1 for audit procedures).

 **The main project team:** Romena (AKL) and Kaspars (LAKA) - project coordinators, Albertas (AKL) and Maikls (LAKA) - web experts, Mantas (AKL) and Aigars (LAKA) - OSS experts. There we also participate 2 members of steering committee, 2 persons from Vilnius City Municipality and additional expert.

 At the end of the project a **UsersGuide** (VartotojoVadovas) will be published as a **result** of the project. The guide will be prepared for municipal workers and will contain rules and recommendations how to create a website compliant with W3C standards, how to prepare electronic documents in open formats. More information about the contents: UsersGuide (VartotojoVadovas).

 January will be the hardest month as we had to postpone December activities for January.

 Here you can find a general plan of project activities and a plan what activities we should do on what months: **PlanOfActivities** (VeikluPlanas), **PlanOfActivitiesMonths** (VeikluPlanasMenesiais). I have also prepared tables for AKL and LAKA activities (not included steering committee and Vilnius City Municipality): [AKLActivities] ([AKLVeiklos]) and [LAKAActivities] ([LAKAVeiklos]). As the tables were made pasting tables made with Calc into Mozillar Composer there can be additional tags/bugs/information. If one want - can correct those.<br>
There are also prepared plans for each type of activity: ProjectCoordination (ProjektoKoordinavimas), WebActivities (WebVeiklos), OSSActivities (OSSVeiklos), InfDissemination (InfSklaida).
