Overview of electronic document types used at municipal institutions

* "list of file formats", used in Lithuanian municipalities websites:

 I noticed, that they use 3 file formats for publishing documents :

 1.M$ Office (.doc, .xls, .ppt)

 2. Portable document format (PDF). PDF forms aren't used in Lithuanian municipalities

 3. Vilnius municipality uses .RTF

 4. HTML, of course ;)

* Problems with document publications:

 1. There are no order - one document is published in HTML, other same kind document - in PDF, other - in M$ Office format, see for example news (announcements) at right side of www.vilnius.lt or at www.kaunas.lt

 2. Municipalites web sites doesn't follow recomendations for governmental institution web sites, published Lithuanian government (for example recommendation number 20 from http://www3.lrs.lt/cgi-bin/preps2?Condition1=209540 tells, that documents should be available also in open formats)

* Other notices

 - Most documents are published only for viewing and reading (not for editing)

 - There are also documents, which should be printed on paper

 - Most municipalities doesn't accept electronic documents from citizens or firms
 (fillable forms are not used)
