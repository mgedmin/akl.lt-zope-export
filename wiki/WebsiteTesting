  *Aigars:*

  I think we should diversify the research - take some big, some medium
  and some small municipalities. Thus we could also compare the results
  accross the size scale.

  I am thinking about 3 staged approach:

  1. w3c validation

  2. cross-browser functionality testing (Firefox, Konqeror, Opera)

  3. downloadable and uploadable file formats

  *Viktoras:*

  I think we should also validate css at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

  and we might check how they appear on different browsers (Mozilla, IE6, IE5, Opera), it's important if they use javascript
