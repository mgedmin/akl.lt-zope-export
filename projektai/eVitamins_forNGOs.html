<h2>eVitamins for NGOs</h2>
<h3>Project summary</h3>
<p>An applicant is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a
non-profit public
organization Atviras Kodas Lietuvai</span> (AKL; Open Source for
Lithuania).
It aims at promoting free and open source software (FOSS) in
Lithuania assuring computer users possibility to get tested and most
qualitative software and professional consultancy.</p>
<p>With this project we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aim</span>
to strengthen
capabilities of Lithuanian non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
raising awareness of information technologies. We see a problem of
low computer literacy and high index of software piracy. And the main
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">problem</span> is that NGOs
don't use information technologies to improve
their work as they lack of awareness of information technologies and,
in most cases, finances for special equipment, too.</p>
<p>Free and open source software we see as
a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solution</span> to
diminish mentioned problems and strengthen capabilities
of organizations as this software is distributed for free while
similar proprietary ones cost huge money. FOSS is also easily
translated into native language and anyone can contribute with
translations or software functionality improvements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main target group</span>
of this project
is non-governmental organizations. We have made a preliminary analyze
and found that stronger organizations already need specialized
software as they get more influence on society wealth and have to
concentrate on implementation of effective activities.</p>
<p>In 8 months <span style="text-decoration: underline;">project
duration</span> we will
provide a suite of software designed to meet the needs of
non-governmental organizations (especially, fundraising, volunteers
management, writing applications, etc.) with user guidelines, and
will train members of different organizations to use this software.</p>
<p>During the project about 300 members of
different NGOs will get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more
computer literate</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">raise
awareness</span> of
free and open source software and many of them will <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">start using the
software</span> for their jobs effectiveness.</p>
<p>It will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a sustainable
project</span> as 3
trainers will be trained to teach their colleagues to use
NGO-specific software. Those 3 trainers will be selected from
non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p>In parallel, we are looking at other
sectors: local government, small business, schools, and forsee
implementation of this project results in other relevant projects.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-governmental
organizations
information and support center</span> was selected as a partner because
of
its long term experience of NGO activities and huge relationship with
other NGOs. </p>
<h3>Overall objective</h3>
<p>To strengthen capabilities of
Lithuanian non-governmental organizations raising awareness of
information technologies</p>
<h3>Objectives </h3>
<p>To provide NGO-specific free and open
source software</p>
<p>To raise awareness of free and open
source software and train members of NGOs to start using it</p>
<p>To provide assistance and consultations
for NGOs' capability improvements</p>
<h3>Justification</h3>
<p>(a) description of present
conditions/situation</p>
<p>There is no official statistics about
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">computer literacy of NGOs</span>
in Lithuania. But there is statistics about
usage of computers at household: last year (in 2003, according to the
Department of Statistics) about 20 percent of household had a
personal computer at home and only 7 percent of household had
Internet access. As large majority of people work for NGOs as
volunteers we could draw a conclusion that similar statistics could
be at NGOs.</p>
<p>We ourselves belong to NGOs and are
involved in the activities of this (“third”) sector. From our
experience communicating with other organizations we have learned
that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NGOs lack awareness of
information technologies</span>. Being involved
in developing Lithuanian information society NGOs have to use
appropriate computer software to improve their casual jobs in order
to provide more efficient services and more concentrate on their
duties for the society. NGOs need specialized software for contact
management, fundraising, filling applications for tenders, etc.</p>
<p>Also, getting finances for
implementation of activities usually organizations are not financed
to purchase computers and software. <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of awareness and lack of
finances</span> force them to use <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">illegal software</span> and one
day they can face
with legal problems. According to the statistics of BSA (Business
Software Alliance) about 5O persent of computer users in Lithuania
use illegal software. And each day BSA more and more threatens computer
users about penalties for using illegal software.</p>
<p>All these mentioned problems are
important for all Lithuanian non-governmental organizations and in
this project we will not concentrate on specific region but try to
reach organizations from all Lithuanian regions.</p>
<p>(b) list of target groups with an
estimate of the anticipated number of direct and indirect
beneficiaries</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More than 200
non-governmental
organizations</span> we see as direct beneficiaries. Those 200 will be
selected as participants of seminars and they will raise awareness of
information technologies and improve their activities integrating
information technologies into their workspace.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another part of Lithuanian
NGOs</span> (more
than 10000 organizations) could also be direct or indirect
beneficiaries as there will be software and user's guidelines
prepared and published on Internet for public use .</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens of Lithuania</span>
that
cooperate with NGOs or get (social, educational) services from NGOs
could be indirect beneficiaries, too. It is hard to estimate the
percent of all population but it is possible to mean all Lithuanian
citizens (that is about 3 million).</p>
<h3>Focus on Innovation</h3>
<p>Software that will be offered for NGOs
will be selected from open source solutions. <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Open source software
itself is innovative</span> as it is open for society to use it for
free, to
copy it and distribute to colleagues, to develop it and improve to
the needs, to be involved in software development and improvement
process not being a technician. Also, open source software is easily
translated into Lithuanian and computer in mother-tongue is an easy
take-off for beginners. The suite of software prepared at this
project will be published on Internet for free access together with
user's guide according to free licences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">InstallFest is an event</span>
to which
participants bring there computers and install open source software
with assistance of experts and consultants. Usually it is for free
participation donating volunteer consultants that assist during
software installation.</p>
<p>At a designed electronic environment (a
website and a conference) members of different NGOs will not only
exchange practices but also will be <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">involved in software development
and improvement</span> process, the software that they use by
themselves.</p>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>250 participants that raised
awareness of IT (a one-day seminar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>80 participants of seminars tested
software themselves (a one-day seminar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40 participants of InstallFest event
(a one-day event)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 trained trainers (a three-day
seminar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User's Guide with a CD of software,
printed in 1000 copies and distributed for NGOs for free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A website www.evitaminai.lt will be
designed for information dissemination, publication of materials and
software, schedules of seminars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1000 copies of brochures will be
printed and distributed with the information of project, its
participants and funding resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 publications in main Lithuanian
dailies and published on Internet portals, in regional newspapers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all the publications and press
releases there will be mentioned about the resource of funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>Project will result effecting main
target group – non-governmental organizations. Members of
Lithuanian NGOs will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">raise
awareness of information technologies</span>
learning about free and open source software, especially the
specialized one for NGOs. After the practical seminars and
InstallFest events participants will install and start using software
that will improve their jobs. This will influence the efficiency of
their services and duties and strengthen organizational capabilities.</p>
<p>We believe that the results of this
project will take effect on high level <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">computer software piracy</span> as
free and open source software is distributed without (or very low)
fee and copied legaly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A website</span> will be
built for information
dissemination, publication of materials and software, schedules of
seminars and will be used in further eVitamins' projects that will be
implemented in different sectors (e.g. business, schools, etc.) after
.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">final conference</span>
will be organized
and there will be invited representatives of NGOs and key persons of
governmental institutions responsible for development of information
society, mass media. It can make an effect on some governmental
regulations concerning the use of software to provide and get public
information.</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project coordination and
management</span>. A
kick-off meeting to schedule a detailed plan of activities and assign
responsibilities. Monitoring and internal evaluation will be used to
track the project progress that the goals were achieved and of higher
quality, to assure effectiveness of activities.</p>
<p>WWW pages will be created at
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.evitaminai.lt</span>.
These pages will contain information about
Free and Open Software, moderated discussions forum, FAQ, software
downloads, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seminars</span> will be
organized in order to
representatives of NGO to get familiar with Free and Open Software
dedicated for office computing needs. <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Trainings</span> will be organized
with theory issues and practice at computers during seminars.</p>
<p>Also organizing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">InstallFest
events</span> that
participants could install software and test it by themselves in
assistance of specialists.</p>
<p>NGO-specific <span style="text-decoration: underline;">software</span>
will be selected
to meet NGOs' needs and a list of software will be improved according
to the feedbacks of seminar participants (both theory and practice).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trainers</span> will be
trained to teach their
colleagues as they will be selected from major non-governmental
organizations of three largest cities to cover different Lithuanian
regions. After the trainings participants will get certificates that
will prove their qualification.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publication of Free and
Open Software
CD</span> and user's guide according to one of the open source licences
for
free on Internet.</p>
<p>Members of different NGOs will get free
expert <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consultations</span>
at electronic conference as most free and open
source experts do that volunteer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final conference</span>
will be held in order
to summarize and make public project activities results. In the
framework of the conference InstallFest event will be organized.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The main index will be satisfied
feedbacks collected from participants of seminars and analyzed,
distributed User's Guide Book with CD containing the software and
installed software during the InstallFest events.</p>
<p>Also – a number of publications in
national dailies and regional newspapers could prove the success.</p>
<p>A number off participants of electronic
conference that will be designed for public consultations, good
practice and ideas exchange. A website and e-conference will become a
virtual environment for communication and software improvement. </p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The suite of software and user's guide
will be published at website www.evitaminai.lt and other NGO portals
for free access for everyone.</p>
<p>The licences of distributed User's
Guide Book and software will allow NGOs to copy the content and give
it to colleagues. They will be published on Internet for free access.</p>
<p>We are planning to organize and
implement eVitamins for other sectors as local authorities, small and
medium business, education.</p>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>During the project the partner
institution will make a detailed analyze on non-governmental
organizations needs for computer software,.will participate at
software selection and evaluation that best suited needs of NGOs.
Also they will use their capacity for inviting and selecting
participants for seminars.</p>
