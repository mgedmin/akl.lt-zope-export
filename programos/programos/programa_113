Math Volcano is a JavaScript web application for memorizing
multiplication tables through "12 x 12." Individual and
cumulative clocktime information is shown in a table. Each
"level" can be repeated until the clocktimes are satisfactory.
Cookies are used to store the clocktime information for
five days after the session.

After completing all levels the sleeping volcano awakens.
